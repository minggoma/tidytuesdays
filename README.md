Hi there! My name is Andrew - I'm currently a fourth-year medical student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, applying into internal medicine. 

For some background on me and what this is - I, like many medical students, got exposure to research while in medical school. Unlike previous research I, and many other medical students, had done prior to medical school, I learned that clinical outcomes research is based mostly on utilizing, cleaning, and analyzing very large datasets rather than benchtop basic research. The importance of speaking the language of data science became apparent rather quickly - not only did I see that being able to efficiently and capably utilize tools like R to perform high-quality data analysis was crucial to doing good outcomes investigation, but I also saw that dubious techniques and low-quality effort were honestly rampant at this level of research and led to an inundation of low quality studies that add nothing to the realm of medical knowledge. 

I had previously taken some coding classes as an undergraduate, but medical school was the place where I really picked up and refined a lot of my R skill. I felt like the level of skill that I had was sufficient to perform the analysis that my attendings asked of me, and I've provided links to different examples of the type of analysis I can perform in a research context. I believe [this paper](https://www.annalsofvascularsurgery.com/article/S0890-5096(25)00911-2/fulltext) accurately reflects the type of analysis I'm capable of doing - I was fortunate and grateful that, for this project, I was able to drive most of the analysis and writing on my own, and I think this is a good representation of the R skill I have at baseline. 

This repository is intended to hold any and all of my Tidy Tuesday attempts.
